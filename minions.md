Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual runescape account in discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them and trade to other real players.

You can also read the [FAQ](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/faq) for answers to common questions.

> Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: [Old School Bot Rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules)


If you notice any mistakes or missing information in this page, you can [add it yourself](https://github.com/gc/obdocs/blob/master/minions.md), or report it to us in the [support server](https://discord.gg/ob)

# Getting started

To get started, firstly [read the rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules), then get yourself a minion by typing `+minion buy`, or `+m buy` for short.

Next, decide what you want to do. Skilling? PVM? Questing? Read the rest of the page to see what you can do, and how - and just do whatever you want to do!

It's highly recommended to join the [support server](http://oldschool.gg/ob) for several reasons: All updates and changes to the bot are announced in the #news channel in the server. We have a #grand-exchange channel you can use to trade/sell items with others. We have a #notifications channel that shows all the rare drops, pets and other things that people are getting in real time!

## Crafting
You can train crafting with the `+craft` command. For example, `+craft 100 leather gloves`. To start training crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using `+craft leather`, then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.

# Questing
Questing in the bot is simple and easy, and roughly 20% faster than ingame. Instead of doing specific quests, you just "quest" and gain QP for "questing". You can keep questing until you reach the max QP.

Quest points are required to kill some bosses (e.g. Vorkath) and required to buy some items (e.g. Barrows gloves).


# Skillcapes

Upon reaching level 99 in a skill, you can purchase a skillcape for 99k by typing `+skillcape <skill_name>`. If it's your first 99, you'll get an untrimmed cape.



# Boosts

Boosts work a little differently on the bot then they do ingame.  Currently, there are 4 types of boosts.  
Those would be **Minion Learning**, **Weekend Boosts**, **Item Speed Boosts** and **XP Boosts**.

#### Minion Learning
Say a monster takes 3 minutes to kill normally.  This means you should be able to kill 10 monsters per trip.  

If you've killed that monster for 25 hours, you'll get a 5% **Speed Boost**.  
(3 minutes per kill) * (95%) = 2.85 minutes per kill  
30 minutes / 2.85 minutes per kill = 10.52 kills per trip.  

If we assume another monster has a kill time of 30 seconds.  
Normally you can kill (30 minutes * 60 seconds) / 30 seconds = 60 per trip.  
If you've killed that monster for 25 hours, 5% speed boost.  
(30 seconds per kill) * (95%) = 28.5 seconds per kill.  
(30 minutes * 60 seconds) / 28.5 seconds per kill = 63.1 kills per trip.  

So **Minion learning** allows you to get more kills in a single trip.  

#### Weekend Boosts

If it takes you 3 minutes to kill a monster, that means 10 kills per trip.  
This trip will normalle take 30 minutes to finish, but now it will take 27 minutes.  
Weekend boosts do not allow you to get extra kills in that trip, it only reduces the time.  
This has the same effect as minion learning, but you have to type more.  

#### Item Speed Boosts
Speed boosts reduce the time it takes your minion to finish a trip by a flat percentage.  If you send your minion to kill a boss, that usually takes 30 minutes to kill, but you have an item in your bank that gives you a 10% boost, that trip will be reduced to 27 minutes.  This does not factor in Minion learning or Weekend boosts, but they all stack with each other.  

Some boosts can stack together, for example an item that gives 10% boost and an item that gives 5% boost, will lower your trip by 15%, or from 30 minutes to 25.5 minutes.  The only items that do **NOT** stack with each other, are pickaxes, axes and mining gloves.  Only the highest value is counted.  

#### XP Boosts
These items just give you a flat percentage boost at the end of the trip.  

#### Examples
**10% boost due to minion learning** vs **10% boost due to the weekend boost.**

*Assume 1 minute per kill:*  
Before quantity is calculated:  
mlearning: 1 * 0.9 = 0.9 minutes per kill  
weekend: 1 minute per kill  

*Quantity:*  
mlearning = 30 / 0.9 = 33.3 = 33 kills per trip  
weekend = 30 / 1 = 30 = 30 kills per trip  

*After quantity is calculated:*  
mlearning: 33 kills per trip for 30 mins  
weekend: 30 kills per trip for (30 * 0.9) mins  
weekend: 30 kills per trip for 27 mins  

*Conclusion:*  
With mlearning you can kill 33 monsters per 30 minutes  
With weekend boost you can kill 30 monsters per 27 minutes  

**Example with mlearning and weekend**  
*Assume 1 minute per kill with a 10% mlearning boost and 10% weekend boost:*  
1 minute per kill * 0.9 = 0.9 minutes per kill  
30 minutes / 0.9 minutes per kill = 33 kills in 30 minutes  
33 kills in (30 * 09) minutes  
33 kills in 27 minutes.  

**Example with mlearning, weekend and item speed boost**  
*Assume 1 minute per kill with a 10% mlearning boost, 10% weekend boost and 10 item speed boost:*  
1 minute per kill *0.8 = 0.8 minutes per kill  
30 minutes / 0.8 minutes per kill = 37 kills in 30 minutes  
37 kills in (30 * 0.9) minutes  
37 kills in 27 minutes.

# Bank Backgrounds

If you meet the requirements and costs of a background, you can get it using `+bankbg <name>`. The image will replace the background of your bank. Bank backgrounds require that you pay GP, items and having certain items in your collection log, they are quite hard to obtain.

Click on the bank bg name to see what it looks like.

| **Name** | **GP Cost** | **Item Cost** | **Collection Log Items Needed** |
| - | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [Default](https://github.com/gc/oldschoolbot/blob/master/resources/images/bank_backgrounds/1.jpg?raw=true) | 0  |   |  |
| [Bandos](https://github.com/gc/oldschoolbot/blob/master/resources/images/bank_backgrounds/7.jpg?raw=true) | 100m | The 4 Godsword Hilts | Entire GWD log excluding pets, + Bandos pet |
| [Corporeal Beast](https://github.com/gc/oldschoolbot/blob/master/resources/images/bank_backgrounds/8.jpg?raw=true) | 100m  |   | Entire Corporeal Beast log including pet |
| [Casket (Legend Arts)](https://github.com/gc/oldschoolbot/blob/master/resources/images/bank_backgrounds/9.jpg) | 100m  |   | The 4 clue milestone item rewards|


# Minion Icons

You can sacrifice items, and their GP value will go towards you unlocking new minion icons. You will automatically receive the icon immediately after sacrificing enough GP. You can see a leaderboard of who has sacrificed the most using `+lb sacrifice`.

You can sacrifice items using `+sacrifice [quantity] <item>`, like `+sacrifice Bandos chestplate` or `+sacrifice 1000 gold ore`. You cannot sacrifice GP, instead you should buy items off other players with your GP and sacrifice those.

| Icon | Amount Required |
